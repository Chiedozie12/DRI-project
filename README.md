# DRI EDIA project

*Welcome! This project is dedicated to training racialized scholars in the Faculty of Health Sciences to utilize Digital Research Infrastructure (DRI).*  

## Vision and Mission

- **Vision:** To empower racialized scholars in the Faculty of Health Sciences for professional progression through DRI tools.
- **Mission:** To improve the knowledge and utilization of DRI tools among scholars in the Faculty of Health Sciences.
## About

Lack of awareness and insufficient training are barriers to accessing DRI tools. Many racialized scholars seem not to be aware of the available DRI tools and resources or know how these tools can benefit their research. There may be limited opportunities for racialized researchers to receive training in DRI tools, leading to a skills gap that prevents them from effectively utilizing these resources. Therefore, training scholars in the Health Science Faculty is essential to demonstrate advanced technical skills for cutting-edge research.
